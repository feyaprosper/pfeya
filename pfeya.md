A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the screenplay (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking.Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed.

### Biography

David Keith Lynch (born January 20, 1946) is an American filmmaker, painter, musician, actor, and photographer. He has been described by The Guardian as "the most important director of this era.” AllMovie called him "the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking," while the success of his films has led to him being labelled "the first popular Surrealist." 


### Early Work

He moved to Los Angeles, where he produced his first motion picture, the surrealist horror film Eraserhead (1977). After Eraserhead became a cult classic on the midnight movie circuit, Lynch was employed to direct a biographical film about a deformed man, Joseph Merrick, titled The Elephant Man (1980). He was then employed by the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and proceeded to make two films: the science-fiction epic Dune (1984), which proved to be a critical and commercial failure, and then a neo-noir crime film Blue Velvet(1986), which stirred controversy over its violence but later grew in critical reputation.
Next, Lynch created his own television series with Mark Frost, the popular murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990–1991). He also created a cinematic prequel, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992), a road movie Wild at Heart (1990) and a family film The Straight Story (1999) in the same period. 

### Later Work

Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on "dream logic" non-linear narrative structures: the psychological thriller Lost Highway (1997), the neo-noir "love story" Mulholland Drive (2001) and the fragmented mystery film Inland Empire (2006). Meanwhile, Lynch embraced the Internet as a medium, producing several web-based shows, such as the animated DumbLand (2002) and the surreal sitcom Rabbits (2002). Lynch and Frost reunited for the Showtime limited series Twin Peaks: The Return (2017), with Lynch co-writing and directing every episode.

### Biography

David Andrew Leo Fincher (born August 28, 1962) is an American director and producer, notably for films, television series and music videos. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and The Social Network (2010). For the latter, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director and the BAFTA Award for Best Direction. 
Fincher likes to map out camera movements with computer-generated imagery, commission intricate sets, get heavily involved in post-production, and re-shoot footage after the principal photography has wrapped.[39] He does not normally use hand-held cameras when he shoots a film, preferring cameras on a tripod. His most frequent use of a hand-held camera was for Seven, in which five scenes were shot that way. 

### Early Work

After directing several music videos, Fincher's feature debut was Alien 3 (1992). While it received an Oscar nomination for visual effects,[12] the film was not well received by critics or moviegoers.[13] Fincher became involved with several disputes with 20th Century Foxover script and budget issues. In Director's Cut: Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century, he blames the producers for not putting the necessary trust in him.
He is also known for having directed the psychological thrillers Seven (1995), The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), and Gone Girl (2014), and the mystery thrillers Zodiac (2007) and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), as well as being instrumental in the creation of the U.S. television series House of Cards (2013-) and Mindhunter (2017-).

### Later Work

In August 2015, budget disputes between Fincher and the network halted production of Utopia, and consequently all three projects were dropped altogether. In 2016, Fincher directed another Netflix series, Mindhunter, starring Holt McCallany and Jonathan Groff. The series, that is based on the book Mind Hunter: Inside the FBI’s Elite Serial Crime Unit, debuted worldwide on October 13, 2017.
